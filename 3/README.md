To create a React app, you can use the `create-react-app` command-line tool. Here are the steps: 1. Install Node.js: To install Node.js, follow the instructions on the official Node.js website. 2. Install `create-react-app`: Open a terminal window and run the following command: 
```bash 
npm install -g create-react-app 
```
3. Create a new React app: Choose a directory where you want to create your app and navigate to that directory using the terminal. Then, run the following command: 
```bash 
npx create-react-app my-app 
```
Replace `my-app` with the name you want to give to your app. This command will create a new directory called `my-app`. Inside this directory, you'll find the basic structure of a React app. 
4. Run your React app: Navigate to the `my-app` directory and run the following command: 
```bash
npm start 
```
This will start a local development server and open your app in a web browser. Now you can start building your React app!
